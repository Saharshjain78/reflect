# Security Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This secure private journaling system implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy. The system follows industry best practices for authentication, authorization, data encryption, and security monitoring.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Email/password authentication with strong password requirements
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration times
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- User roles: `user`, `admin`
- Admin access limited to system metrics and monitoring
- No admin access to user journal content
- Middleware-enforced authorization checks

#### Password Security
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- bcrypt hashing with salt rounds of 12
- Password validation on both client and server

### 2. Data Privacy Architecture

#### Database Isolation
- Row-level security implementation
- User data partitioning by hashed user IDs
- Encrypted user identifiers in database queries

#### Encryption at Rest
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all journal content
- Separate encryption keys per user session
- Secure key management system
- Encrypted backups

#### Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected and stored
- Automatic cleanup of old session data
- Configurable data retention policies

### 3. Access Control Implementation

#### Middleware Security
- Authentication verification on all protected routes
- Ownership validation before CRUD operations
- Request validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations

#### API Security
- Input validation using express-validator
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection through content sanitization
- Request size limits

### 4. Security Monitoring

#### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all access attempts
- Failed authentication tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Automated security alerts

#### Intrusion Detection
- Rate limiting and IP blocking
- Pattern recognition for suspicious behavior
- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated incident response

#### Compliance
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data protection regulation adherence
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing protocols

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates input and checks rate limits
3. Password verification using bcrypt
4. JWT token generation with user claims
5. Token validation on subsequent requests
6. Automatic token refresh mechanism

### Data Encryption Process

1. Content encryption using AES-256-GCM
2. Unique initialization vectors per encryption
3. Authentication tags for integrity verification
4. Secure key derivation from master key
5. Encrypted storage in database

### Audit Trail

All security-relevant events are logged including:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Data access patterns
- Administrative actions
- System errors and exceptions

### Backup Security

- Encrypted backup files
- Automated daily backups
- Secure backup storage
- Backup integrity verification
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required security configuration
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<encryption-master-key>
SESSION_SECRET=<session-secret>

# Optional security settings
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000  # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100        # requests per window
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5     # auth attempts per window
```

### Security Headers

The application implements security headers including:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Metrics

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious IP activity
- System performance metrics
- Error rates and patterns

### Alert Conditions

- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- System errors or failures
- Security policy violations
- Performance degradation

## Incident Response

### Automated Responses

- IP blocking for suspicious activity
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Security alert notifications
- Backup system activation

### Manual Procedures

1. Incident identification and classification
2. Containment and isolation
3. Investigation and analysis
4. Recovery and restoration
5. Post-incident review

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regular Security Reviews

- Monthly security assessments
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual security audits
- Continuous vulnerability scanning

### Documentation Requirements

- Security policy documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Access control matrices
